# F# Mutable Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with mutable variables in F# functions. The `add` function is designed to add two numbers, but due to the way mutable variables are handled, it produces unexpected results. 

The `bug.fs` file contains the code with the error. The `bugSolution.fs` file provides a corrected version.

## Setup

To run the code, you will need the .NET SDK installed on your system.  You can then compile and run the F# code using the F# compiler (fsc.exe).
